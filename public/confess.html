      <p class="col-sm-3 confession">If you're not happy in health sci then definitely don't feel like you're stuck here! You didn't 'take' anyone's spot...I'm sure everyone that deserved to be here made it! Having said that, don't spend your time doing something that makes you miserable. It might be a difficult choice to make now but hopefully you won't regret it in the future..Hang in there!</p>
      <p class="col-sm-3 confession">to the people who wanna leave the program: i am sure you guys are not alone, and not having a proper first year is prob adding to it. we havnt experienced what it is like being a mac health sci kid yet. we have missed out on so much fun and opportunities, im sure 2nd year (if in person or hybrid) will be so so so much better. It does get better :) just know that there are some amazing people in health sci that will bring you do much joy! you just need to find your people</p>
