      <p>The code used for operating the authentication, sign-in and security of this website is entirely open-source. This means that your information is completely secure and stored using Firebase servers.</p>
      <p>Your sign-up email and display name are visible to the web developer in the Firebase Authentication Console, as well as a generated specific user ID that is unique to you when you sign up for an account. You can delete your account at any time through the account details option on the logged in page, but you need to have signed in recently to delete the account, as a security measure. If you delete your account, your sign-up details will be permanently removed from the Firebase Authentication Console. If you wish to delete any posts or contributions to the Firestore Database that you made, please contact the web developer, who will carry out your request.</p>
      <p>The logged in page is private to users whose email address ends in "@mcmaster.ca", as a security measure against those outside of our university community. If such alien users try to sign up for an account, the private page is hidden from them, and their account is automatically deleted. Keep in mind, while the Terms of Service ask you to refrain from sharing the information on this website with those outside of the McMaster University community, this cannot be entirely prevented, since users can just show these pages to those outside of their community. With that in mind, do not post overly sensitive information on these forums.</p>
      <p>The web developer has taken extensive efforts to protect your private information. If you have questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:umaira1@mcmaster.ca">umaira1@mcmaster.ca</a>.</p>
