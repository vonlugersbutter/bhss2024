        <p id="grace" class="beef boi">Hey hey hey! It’s Grace, your First Year Representative and proud member of the Ignacio house! I’m so thrilled to be here with you all, and am awaiting the day that we can finally be in each other’s physical presence. On the days that I am able to get out of bed, I do so entirely for bubble tea and cuddles with my cat, Bean. If you ever have any questions about FYC, or just want to chat about life, I’m your girl! My inbox is always open! Current mood? Desperately longing for a walk by the beach at sunset and a drive through the city at night.</p>

        <p id="alexx" class="beef boi">My name is Alexander, but everyone calls me Alex! I grew up in Toronto, Ontario and have lived here my whole life. I attended Upper Canada College for high school, and my main interests include hockey and writing. I am incredibly excited to continue working with my fellow FYC members to bring everyone at BHSc an amazing set of academic resources so they can do their best in first year!</p>

        <p id="emily" class="beef boi">Hey everyone! I’m Emily, and I’ll be serving as one of your Academic Leads (as well as a proud member of Aquatico!) this year. I enjoy dabbling in graphic design and spending altogether too much time making my notes look pretty, and I’m probably the most simultaneously anxious and chill person that I know. I’m on social media far too often for an “academic” lead, but that also means that if you ever have any questions, concerns, or feedback on things that the Academic Team is doing, you can always feel free to reach out to me!</p>

        <p id="alexp" class="beef boi">Hi! I'm Alex (one of) and I enjoy books, Christmas movie, being outside and finding new ways to justify my chocolate addiction. I'm very happy to be one of the FYC academic leads this year and will continue to work on aiding our cohort on all academic-related needs!</p>

        <p id="ahad" class="beef boi">Hey there! My name’s Ahad, I’m one of the Event Leads for this year. Born in Toronto, moved to Karachi, moved to Doha, moved back to Karachi and now I’m back in Canada for good haha. I’m always trying to keep myself busy doing something- which pretty much varies from cooking to cycling. I also enjoy running, reading and hiking. I’m really looking forward to campus opening so I can meet you all soon!</p>

        <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="michael()">Events Lead</button>
        <p id="michael" class="beef boi">A fervent pandemic has spread its wrathful wings over McMaster, acting as a harbinger for a seemingly ruined first-year for Michael Wang. However, he has arisen to face the adversity of Covid-19, assimilating into the role of events lead. Michael has copious ideas to build a memorable first-year experience for all his peers, to be cherished for years to come. He hopes to engender real connections and community in a virtual environment. Outside of his council duties and academic commitments, Michael fanatically studies the world of bubble tea connoisseurs, explores the imaginative world of fashion, strives to achieve internet stardom, or carries his fellow FYC treasurer, Dimitri Deris, in League of Legends.</p>
