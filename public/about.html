    <h3>And now, a secret message from the web developer.</h3>
    <p>Hello! If you're curious as to what this website was built with, it was made using HTML/CSS/JS, specifically Bootstrap 4, and hosted on Firebase. Unfortunately, the code for this website is not available to the public because of some sensitive information, but if you're interested in learning how to make websites using programming languages, then reach out to me at <a href="mailto:umaira1@mcmaster.ca">umaira1@mcmaster.ca</a> and I can give you some great resources.</p>
